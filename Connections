MAX30105 (Pulse Oximeter and Heart Rate Sensor):

VCC: Connect to 5V (or 3.3V depending on your board specifications).
GND: Connect to GND.
SCL: Connect to SCL pin on the microcontroller (e.g., GPIO 22 on an ESP32).
SDA: Connect to SDA pin on the microcontroller (e.g., GPIO 21 on an ESP32).

OLED Display (SSD1306):

VCC: Connect to 3.3V or 5V depending on your OLED module.
GND: Connect to GND.
SCL: Connect to SCL pin (same as the MAX30105 SCL pin).
SDA: Connect to SDA pin (same as the MAX30105 SDA pin).

Buzzer (for Heart Attack Alert):

One leg: Connect to GPIO 13 (or any available pin on your microcontroller).
Other leg: Connect to GND.

Panic Button:

One leg: Connect to GPIO 12 (or any available input pin on the microcontroller).
Other leg: Connect to GND.
Set the button with an internal pull-up resistor, so when pressed, the input reads LOW.

Wi-Fi (ESP32):

The Wi-Fi module is already built into the ESP32 (or ESP8266) board, so no extra connections are needed for Wi-Fi. You just need to configure the SSID and password in the code.
